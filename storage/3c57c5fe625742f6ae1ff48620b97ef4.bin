Introduction

It’s estimated artificial intelligence (AI) will add as much as $15.7 trillion (more than Rs 1214 lakh crore) to the global economy by 2030. RAISE 2020 will be a global meeting of minds to exchange ideas and chart a course for using AI for social transformation, inclusion and empowerment in areas like Healthcare, Agriculture, Education and Smart Mobility, among other sectors.
Main Body:

Impact of Artificial Intelligence on society:
India is well-positioned to become a global leader in the development of artificial intelligence. Industry analysts predict that AI could add up to $957 billion to India’s economy by 2035.
From agriculture to fin-tech and healthcare to infrastructure, artificial intelligence can be a truly transformative force. India is uniquely positioned to become the AI laboratory of the world and contribute to inclusive development and growth through empowerment. 
The Summit aims to help create a data-rich environment, which is a stepping stone to eventually transforming lives globally.
RAISE 2020 is a first-of-its-kind, global meeting of minds on Artificial Intelligence to drive India's vision and roadmap for social transformation, inclusion and empowerment through responsible AI. 
Challenges:
Advanced nations vs developing nations: If current trends continue, much of this new wealth will be owned and controlled by corporations and individuals based in China and the United States, as well as by the national governments that represent them.
But technological superiority by great powers undermines the positive potential of AI for the majority of the world’s population, particularly in developing economies.
The US and China account for more than 94 per cent of funding for AI startups over the past five years and half of the world’s hyper-scale data centres.
The two countries possess roughly 90 per cent of the market capitalisation of the world’s 70 largest digital platforms, controlling a large proportion of cross-border data flows.
The nations that own and control AI platforms and the data that powers them stand to dominate the global economy for decades to come.
Experts in the field are also mostly from developed economies. They enjoy a disproportionate representation in the industry bodies that develop the standards and technical protocols that shape the international regulations for AI, often at the expense of the differing needs of developing economies.
Lacks coordination: Over 160 sets of AI ethics and governance frameworks have so far been developed by policymakers, think tanks, and activists. Still, there are no platforms to coordinate these initiatives, or measures to ensure national governments align AI regulations and norms across international boundaries.
The growing divide has implications for developing economies marginalized by the emerging AI sector.
Measures to prevent domination of few in AI field:
A recently released report from a working group convened by the Paris Peace Forum says an open, international dialogue on equitable AI governance could help set up global regulations.
Governments of developing economies can remedy the widening imbalance between data providers and data collectors by creating incentives for foreign tech companies to invest in domestic research and development facilities to amplify local AI capabilities.
It is also important to deter ‘brain drain’, where top experts leave their homes to pursue international opportunities, by promoting incentives such as funds for innovation and R&D to retain and further develop domestic talent.
 Conclusion:

In the spirit of ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’, honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi plans to leverage AI for inclusive development, representing the country's 'AI for All' strategy. Directed by the Prime Minister’s vision, India will soon stand out in the international community not just as a leader in the Artificial Intelligence field, but also as a model to show the world how to responsibly direct AI for social empowerment.
The benefits of AI are plenty, but mitigating the potential harm is crucial. An international dialogue, focused on results, can create an equitable distribution of AI technologies.
