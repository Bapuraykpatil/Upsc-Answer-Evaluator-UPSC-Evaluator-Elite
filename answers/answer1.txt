Define the term briefly. Governance is the process of decision-making and the process by which decisions are implemented (or not). While 'Government' is the structure, 'Governance' is the function. It involves the State, Market, and Civil Society.
Body: The Three Dimensions of Authority
Political Authority: Relates to policy formulation and the legitimacy of the state.
Example: The role of the Parliament and State Legislatures in debating laws like the Data Protection Act.
Economic Authority: Involves processes that affect a country’s economic activities and its relationships with other economies.
Example: NITI Aayog’s Cooperative Federalism approach and the GST Council’s role in fiscal management.
Administrative Authority: Refers to the system of policy implementation.
Example: The transition from "Rules-based" to "Roles-based" bureaucracy under Mission Karmayogi.
The Shift Toward "Good Governance"
To maximize the "10-mark" potential, mention the 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) recommendations:
Citizen-Centricity: Using Citizen Charters to ensure accountability.
Technology (e-Gov): The JAM Trinity (Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile) which ensures leakage-free Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT).
Decentralization: Empowering Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) as per the 73rd/74th Amendments.
Conclusion
Governance must move toward "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance." It is not merely about exercising power but about ensuring Equitable and Inclusive development (Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas) to achieve the goal of a Viksit Bharat by 2047.
